# Face Recognition Attendance System

This project implements a face recognition attendance system using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces in the video stream, and recognizes known faces to mark attendance. The attendance data is then stored in a CSV file.

## Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Detect faces in a live video stream using a webcam.
2. Recognize known faces using pre-trained face encodings.
3. Mark attendance for recognized faces and store the data in a CSV file.

## Dependencies

- Python
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- numpy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Place images of the individuals you want to recognize in the same directory as the script.
4. Modify the paths to the image files in the script according to your directory structure.
5. Run the Python script.
6. When prompted, allow access to the webcam.
7. The system will start recognizing faces and marking attendance.
8. Press 'q' to exit the application.

## File Structure

- `attendance_system.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the face recognition attendance system.
- Sample images: Images of individuals used for face recognition.

## Configuration

Ensure that you have a webcam connected to your system and it is properly configured to capture video.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.
